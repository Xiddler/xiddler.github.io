      <p>This is the week of Cheltenham the week the paddies go mad with horses
in preparation for Paddy's Day. This year there is the added prospect of
maybe stealing the rugby Grand Slam from under the noses of our English
brethren at Twickers. But let me not get distracted by that prospect of
glory.</p>
<p>I want to mention a few things I have picked up over the years around
horses.</p>
<p>The first is horse sense. There is the old definition which states that
horse sense is what stops horses from betting on people.</p>
<p>All modern racing horses are descended from 3 Arabian horses. Never
checked the veracity that.</p>
<p>Monty Python used the phrase "That's a horse of a different colour" in a
very literal but inexact way. His horse was a horse of varying colour. I
still liked the gag.</p>
<p>My father was a veterinary surgeon in the local area. He was known for
his expertise with horses although I'm not sure why. However, family
lore has it that a telegram was sent once upon a time, referring to my
father, and in relation to a very ill horse, which stated: "Get same
young vet to examine horse"</p>
<p>I did witness his learned and practical expertise on a number of
occasions. Tasked with bringing a horse to the ground for examination or
other, he executed a very intricate series of knots and loops around the
horse and with a tug or two gently brought the horse to the ground. This
made a big impression on me and I went on to learn many knots including
a series used for rock-climbin.</p>
<p>For our tenth birthday, my twin and I received a present of a donkey. A
white donkey. But as we did not have any where to keep him, my uncle
(Tom) kindly offered. I don't think I ever saw that donkey again.
Birthday presents were cheap back then...</p>
